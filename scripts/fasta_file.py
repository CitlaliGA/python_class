DESCRIPTION
    This programs gets a text file with dna sequences as input and returns a  file with the sequences
    in fasta format, without non alphanumeric characters, with capital letters and including the headers
    for each sequence

CATEGORY
     DNA sequence analysis

USAGE
    None

ARGUMENTS
    This program doesn't take arguments

INPUT
    The file with the DNA sequence given by the user

OUTPUT
    A fasta file with the sequences of dna

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: gets seq_1 = "ATCGTACGATCGATCGATCGCTAGACGTATCG" and returns
    > seq_1
    ATCGTACGATCGATCGATCGCTAGACGTATCG
